Project Details
---------------
Project Title: B o u n c e
Colour Bounce 

Project Description: 

There is a bouncing ball that changes colours on each bounce. You can 
land on the (static) platforms only of the same colour. 
The colour of the platforms will change randomly, so you must decide on 
which platform to land on carefully.
To land on a platform, you must press the key associated with that 
platform at a certain time.
If the ball falls to the bottom then you lose. You get points the longer 
you bounce.

Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?: 

Draw a static screen of the game. (Drawing ball and platforms using VGA)

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab 
session?: 

Implement module that will randomize the platform and ball colours.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?: 

Implement the animation part of this project (i.e. the bouncing part of 
the ball),
and also the module to keep track of the points of the bouncing ball 
(i.e. when the ball successfully 
lands on a platform, or when it fails).

What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned? 

Goal: Try to book the Makerspace boards to make up the lost time.
If this is not possible then at least meet up to try to rework our 
plan/code.

If the backbone of our plan doesn’t work out as planned, we may have to 
turn to similar, alternate ideas.
We will pick rationally according to what we have already completed and 
what is not really working out. 

One possible alternate idea: 

- A ball jump/climb upwards onto available randomly generated platforms 
until the user misses a platform. 
These platforms are not static and new platforms will populate as the 
ball escalates. The higher the ball, the more points.


What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board 

(be sure to e-mail Brian if it’s anything beyond the basics to make sure 
there’s enough to go around)
- VGA

Updates
-------

<Example update. Delte this and add your own updates after each lab 
session>
Week 1: We built the hardware and tested the sensors. The distance 
sensor we had intended to use didn't work as
expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work 
accurately within 5-10cm), so instead
we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead. Had 
trouble getting the FSM to work (kept
getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we 
may not be able to add the
high score feature, have updated that in the project description as 
(optional).
